                    <p>1. Impressionism is a tendency to oppose the tradition of the Academy pursued by the judges of the French Salon and the basic ideology of Romanticism that dominated French art from the early to mid-19th century. Impressionists deviated from traditional styles, adopted new styles, and excluded emotion from painting. It ignores the fundamental spirit of Romanticism, which emphasizes the expression of the artist's emotions.</p>

                        <p>2. Nature and the field of life were recorded as objectively as possible and in accordance with the scientific spirit. In Monet's case, he tried to record the role or effect of light on the subject by depicting the same subject at the same time and place. Since he only painted what he saw with his own eyes, his paintings deserve to be called 'scientific realism'. </p>

                        <p>3.The color division method was used to divide the colors into small pieces, and through free observation, the bright and subtle impression of the atmosphere was delivered. At that time, in an era when it was natural to paint indoors, Monet and other Impressionist painters went out to nature to ob serve objects. So, realizing that the scene of nature and life seen in the light is never fixed, and the form is also not constant, I tried to show it in reality. </p>
